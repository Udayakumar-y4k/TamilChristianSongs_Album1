# TamilChristianSongs_Album1
This song is a direct vision of Revelation 19:11–16 — the glorious return of Christ as conquering King. The white horse symbolizes purity and victory, the many crowns His supreme authority, the sword from His mouth the power of His Word to judge and overcome evil. We sing not in fear, but in triumphant worship, for our King has already won.
